    <p>
      Although St. Martin’s describes itself as “Gnostic,” we celebrate the Eucharist and other Sacraments in a
      fully conventional manner. As such, the form of our Mass would be familiar to anyone from the Roman
      Catholic, Anglican/Episcopalian, or Lutheran traditions – as, in fact, from many other established
      Christian denominations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, while we hold all religions in reverence, it should be noted that the ACGRC is not connected with
      the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientalis). Likewise, our practices are quite distinct from those of the Ecclesia
      Gnostica Catholica, or any other churches who may share the appellation “Gnostic,” but whose liturgy
      may be decidedly unconventional.

    <p>
      We share this disclaimer in order that all who wish to share with us at the Lord’s Table may do so in
      perfect confidence that they will be welcomed to a reverent, traditional form of Christian worship and
      fellowship.
