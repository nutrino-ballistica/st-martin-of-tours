        The Apostolic Church of the Golden &amp; Rosy Cross is descended from
        the Pre Nicene Ecclesia of +Richard, Duc de Palatine. Richard
        consecrated two bishops, +Stephan Hoeller who runs the Gnostic Church
        based in Los Angeles, and Count +George Boyer, who ran the Pre Nicene
        Ecclesia until his death, and was succeeded by his wife +Leila Boyer
        who, on her passing, passed the Church to +Michael N. Buckley.
      </p>

      <p>
        After +Michael Buckley succeeded +Leila Boyer as the head of the Pre
        Nicene Ecclesia. +Michael N. Buckley appointed +Piers A. Vaughan as the
        Patriarch of the Apostolic Church of the Golden &amp; Rose Cross.
        +Michael N.  Buckley also appointed +Piers A. Vaughan as a Bishop in the
        Pre Nicene Ecclesia for the See of New York.

        The Apostolic Church of the Golden &amp; Rosy Cross has a small number
        of bishops, priests and deacons in the United States, and, while a
        completely independent Church, has a close tie with the Martinist Order
        of Unknown Philosophers (MOUP). Gnostic in outlook, its clergy provide
        the Mass, Blessings, Weddings, Baptisms, Healings and Funeral Services.
        It also operates the Healing and Teaching Order of Ss. Michael &amp;
        Raphael; while an influx of Rosicrucian currents empower it to to offer
        a number of other healing ministries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Pre Nicene Ecclesia is a standalone Gnostic Church, and is not
        connected to any other Order, except for the Healing and Teaching Order
        of Ss. Michael &amp; Raphael, and as such, is a Church that is open to
        all.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the near future it hopes to offer courses based on traditional
        ecclesiastical training, but with a strong emphasis both on gnostic and
        ecumenical education, as well as providing access to the prodigious
        teachings of Palatine and Boyer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Church has a particular devotion to the Divine Feminine and to
        healing, as exemplified by the symbol of the Blessed Virgin, as avatar,
        symbol, human, and successor to all religions which recognize the
        importance of Sophia and the balance of the two great currents.
